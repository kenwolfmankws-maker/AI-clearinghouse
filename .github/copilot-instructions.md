# Copilot Coding Agent Instructions

This repository uses GitHub Copilot's coding agent. Please follow these best practices:

## 1. Task Planning
- Always break down complex requests into actionable todos.
- Use the structured todo list to track progress and mark completion.

## 2. Code Changes
- Use clear, concise commit messages.
- Prefer atomic commits for each logical change.
- Reference related issues or PRs in commit messages when relevant.

## 3. Pull Requests
- Open a PR for every significant change.
- Add a summary describing what changed and why.
- Request review from relevant collaborators.

## 4. Error Handling
- After making code changes, always check for errors and test failures.
- Fix new errors before marking a task as complete.

## 5. Documentation
- Update documentation for any new features or changes.
- Add comments to code where logic is non-obvious.

## 6. Security & Compliance
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.
- Follow repository-specific security guidelines.

## 7. Communication
- Use the todo list and PR descriptions to communicate progress and blockers.
- If a task cannot be completed, document the reason and next steps.
