# AI Clearinghouse Architecture Report
**Generated by MASTERBUILDER | December 16, 2025**

## Executive Summary

The AI Clearinghouse project now has a **clear architectural separation** between two distinct user experiences:

1. **AI Clearinghouse Entry Portal** (root `/`)
2. **Wolfman's Cosmic Cowboy Porch** (`/porch`)

This separation ensures each experience maintains its unique identity while sharing backend infrastructure.

---

## Current Architecture

### 🏠 Root Experience: AI Clearinghouse Entry Portal

**Purpose:** Gateway hub for multiple AI portals and experiences.

**Implementation:**
- **Production:** `/index.html` (served by Vercel at root)
- **Local Dev:** `/index.html` (served by `local-server.cjs` at `http://localhost:3000/`)
- **Features:**
  - Portal navigation grid with cards for each experience
  - Direct chat interface with Eldon (OpenAI integration)
  - Expandable design for future portals
  - Clear visual hierarchy with gradient backgrounds and glow effects

**Key Components:**
- Embedded inline CSS with theme matching project aesthetics
- Inline JavaScript for chat functionality
- Links to `/porch` for Cosmic Cowboy experience
- Placeholder cards for future portals (Signal Hub, Lab Station)

**Status:** ✅ **ACTIVE** – Fully implemented as of this report

---

### 🌌 Porch Experience: Wolfman's Cosmic Cowboy Porch

**Purpose:** Standalone immersive chat environment with cosmic/western theming.

**Implementation:**
- **Production:** `/porch/index.html` (Vercel rewrite rule in `vercel.json`)
- **Local Dev:** `http://localhost:3000/porch` (Express static middleware)
- **Features:**
  - Animated starfield background (CSS keyframes)
  - Cowboy-themed local chat responses (fallback, no API)
  - Immersive dark cosmic aesthetic
  - Self-contained with dedicated styles and scripts

**Key Components:**
- `/porch/index.html` – Entry point
- `/porch/style.css` – Cosmic styling with starfield animations
- `/porch/script.js` – Starfield spawner + local cowboy chat logic

**Status:** ✅ **ACTIVE & UNCHANGED** – No modifications made per MASTERBUILDER constraints

---

## Routing Configuration

### Vercel (Production)

Configured in `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/porch",
      "destination": "/porch/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Root (`/`) → `/index.html` (Clearinghouse Entry Portal)
- `/porch` → `/porch/index.html` (Cosmic Cowboy Porch)
- API routes → `/api/chat.js` (serverless function)

### Local Development

Configured in `local-server.cjs`:
```javascript
app.use('/porch', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'porch')));
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
});
```

- `http://localhost:3000/` → Root Clearinghouse Entry Portal
- `http://localhost:3000/porch` → Cosmic Cowboy Porch
- `http://localhost:3000/api/chat` → OpenAI chat endpoint

---

## Legacy and Deprecated Files

### ⚠️ `/public/index.html`

**Status:** LEGACY – Local dev testing only

This file was previously used as a local development interface but has been superseded by the root `index.html`. It has been updated with clear comments indicating its legacy status.

**Purpose Now:** Minimal fallback for local testing scenarios only.

**Action Required:** Consider removing in future cleanup if no longer needed.

---

## What Was Created

### New Root Portal Experience (`/index.html`)

**Before:** Generic "AI Clearinghouse" chat interface without navigation or clear purpose.

**After:** Comprehensive portal hub with:
- Hero header explaining the Clearinghouse mission
- Portal navigation grid (3 cards: Porch active, 2 planned)
- Inline quick-chat interface with Eldon
- Footer branding
- Responsive design with hover effects
- Theme consistency (dark gradients, cyan/blue accents)
- TODO comments for future expansion points

**Design Principles Applied:**
- Clarity over cleverness ✓
- No frameworks introduced ✓
- Inline styles/scripts for simplicity ✓
- Labeled expansion points with TODO comments ✓

---

## What Was Left Intentionally Empty

### Placeholder Portal Cards

Two portal cards in the navigation grid are marked as "COMING SOON" / "PLANNED":

1. **📡 Signal Hub** – Real-time AI coordination center
2. **🔬 Lab Station** – Model experimentation interface

These are **intentionally non-functional** placeholders with:
- Dashed borders
- Reduced opacity (50%)
- `cursor: default` to indicate non-clickable state
- Status badges indicating development stage

**Purpose:** Communicate roadmap and future expansion without promising immediate functionality.

---

## Verification Checklist

✅ Root (`/`) renders Clearinghouse Entry Portal  
✅ `/porch` renders Cosmic Cowboy Porch (unchanged)  
✅ Vercel routing configuration preserved  
✅ Local server routing updated with clarity  
✅ No Porch scripts or styles modified  
✅ No frameworks introduced  
✅ TODO comments added for future expansion  
✅ Legacy files clearly marked  

---

## Deployment Domains

Both experiences are accessible via:
- `https://aiclearinghouse.ai` (root and `/porch`)
- `https://ai-clearinghouse.vercel.app` (root and `/porch`)

Vercel automatically handles routing per `vercel.json` configuration.

---

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Remove `/public/index.html`** after confirming no dependencies
2. **Implement Signal Hub** portal with real-time monitoring
3. **Implement Lab Station** portal for model experimentation
4. **Add navigation breadcrumbs** to Porch to return to Clearinghouse
5. **Consider shared component library** if portal count exceeds 5
6. **Add analytics** to track portal usage patterns
7. **Create consistent branding footer** across all portals

## File Manifest

### Active Production Files
- `/index.html` – Clearinghouse Entry Portal (root)
- `/porch/index.html` – Cosmic Cowboy Porch entry
- `/porch/style.css` – Porch styling (unchanged)
- `/porch/script.js` – Porch logic (unchanged)
- `/api/chat.js` – OpenAI serverless endpoint
- `/local-server.cjs` – Express server for local dev
- `/vercel.json` – Vercel routing configuration

### Legacy/Dev-Only Files
- `/public/index.html` – Legacy local dev interface (marked)
- `/public/style.css` – Legacy styles
- `/public/chat-frontend.js` – Legacy chat script

### Shared Infrastructure
- `/lib/oidc.js` – JWT verification (not portal-specific)
- `/scripts/*` – CLI utilities and tooling
- `/.github/workflows/*` – CI/CD automation

---

## Conclusion

The AI Clearinghouse now has a **distinct architectural identity** separate from the Porch experience. The root portal serves as a navigation hub and expansion point, while the Porch remains a self-contained immersive environment. Routing works consistently across local development and production deployments.

**All objectives completed successfully.**
